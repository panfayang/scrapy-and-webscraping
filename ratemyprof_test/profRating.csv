4,Karyn Boatwright,"Her emphasis on pedagogical equality between students and teacher (i.e. everyone can learn from everyone else) comes off more as laziness, or at least an underdeveloped approach.

1,Ellen Caldwell,"Worst professor I had at K College.  She ruined my grade point average by giving me a B+.  Hard work was not rewarded.  Even after turning in every assignment early and getting feedback, professor refused to see another point of view.  All of the grades were rounded down to overall reduce everyone's grades.
